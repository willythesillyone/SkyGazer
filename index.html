<h1 class="glow">Yes, we gaze upon the very same sky, but my heart longs to paint it with shooting stars. So that with every fleeting streak of light, I can wish with all my being for us to be forever entwined, for your love, your tenderness, and your care to always surround me. I yearn for a bond that never falters, where understanding blossoms endlessly between us. Love you always, Laksmi.</h1>
